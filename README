README (PyXicht)

    PyXicht is a simplified version of the visual CPU load monitoring tool
    Xicht. See

        https://github.com/urbanware-org/xicht

    for details about it.

    The original Xicht project is written in C# and runs on Linux (and other
    platforms aside Windows) using the Mono runtime. However, in the past a
    memory leak inside external libraries used by Mono led to steadily
    increasing memory consumption making the usage of Xicht more or less
    inconvenient on other platforms than Windows.

    In order to get around this problem until it was solved, the PyXicht
    project was created. As the name suggests, it is written in Python and it
    takes advantage of the Qt framework to display the graphics.

    As mentioned above, PyXicht is quite limited as the window size is fixed,
    there is no right-click menu and also no tray icon available. In short, it
    does not really have any options except closing it once it is running.

    Like the Xicht project, PyXicht comes with some great high resolution face
    images. Special thanks to Reinchard for designing and kindly providing
    them. See

        https://github.com/urbanware-org/xicht#graphics

    for an overview of the graphics.

    PyXicht is and was not intended to be or become an actual alternative to
    Xicht. It was written in a short time and the code definitely needs some
    improvement. Furthermore, it will remain in the state it is now, so there
    will be no enhancements, improvements or whatsoever.
